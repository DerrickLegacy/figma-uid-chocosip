ChocoSip Cafe App Design Report
Project Overview
This report documents the design process and outcome for both low-fidelity (lo-fi) and high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes created in Figma for ChocoSip, a cafe specializing in coffee and chocolate beverages. The goal of this project was to design an intuitive and visually cohesive user experience where customers can explore products, place orders, and opt for delivery or pickup. This report highlights the objectives, design stages, challenges, and learnings from the project.
Objectives
The primary objectives for designing ChocoSip were:

1. To create a user-friendly interface (UI) allowing customers to easily view and order cafe offerings.
2. To develop a smooth, efficient ordering system with options for both in-store pickup and delivery.
3. To establish a warm, cohesive visual style that reflects the cozy, inviting ambiance of a cafe setting.
   Design Process
   The design process followed a structured approach that included research, wireframing, and prototype creation:
4. Research
   o The initial stage involved researching popular cafe and beverage apps, including Starbucks and Dunkin', to understand best practices for UI/UX in a similar context. Key takeaways were to focus on simplicity, accessibility, and a streamlined shopping experience, ensuring a user-friendly and visually attractive interface.
5. Sketching and Wireframing (Lo-Fi Prototype)
   o The lo-fi prototype was created in Figma, focusing on layout and navigation flow without emphasizing detailed design elements. This wireframe served as a blueprint, defining basic screen elements and mapping the logical flow from browsing to checkout. Core screens at this stage included the Login, Home, Menu, and Order screens.
6. High-Fidelity Prototype
   o The hi-fi prototype built upon the lo-fi wireframes, incorporating color schemes, typography, high-quality images, and interactive elements to bring the ChocoSip brand to life. Key design decisions for the hi-fi prototype included:
    Color Palette: A warm palette featuring shades of brown and cream, reflecting the earthy tones associated with coffee and chocolate.
    Typography: Clean, modern fonts chosen for legibility across various screen sizes.
    Imagery: High-quality images of beverages were added to create an inviting browsing experience.
    Buttons and Interactive Elements: Prominent buttons like "Add to Cart" and "Order Now" were placed strategically for quick and easy actions, enhancing the overall user experience.
   Screens and Design Rationale
7. Login Screen
   o Purpose: Securely allows registered users to access their accounts.
   o Design: Includes fields for email and password, a "Login" button, and a "Forgot Password?" link. Branding elements were kept minimal to keep focus on the login form.
   o User Flow: After logging in, users are directed to the Home Screen.
8. Sign Up Screen
   o Purpose: Quick registration process for new users.
   o Design: Fields for name, email, and password, along with a "Sign Up" button and a link to the Login Screen for existing users.
   o User Flow: Upon successful registration, users are shown a Success Notification Screen.
9. Home Screen
   o Purpose: Serves as the main dashboard, showcasing featured drinks and categories.
   o Design: Displays drink categories, featured products, and a navigation bar for easy access to other screens.
   o User Flow: Users can browse categories or go to other screens, such as Favourites, Orders, or the Menu.
10. Drink Menu Screen
    o Purpose: Allows users to browse the full drink menu.
    o Design: Scrollable grid with drink images, names, and prices, along with an “Add to Cart” option.
    o User Flow: Users can customize orders (e.g., size, add-ons) and add items to their cart.
11. Your Orders Screen
    o Purpose: Track active and past orders.
    o Design: List view with sections for active and completed orders, displaying order details and status.
    o User Flow: Users can view ongoing orders or reorder from past purchases.
12. Favourites Screen
    o Purpose: Quick access to saved favorite drinks.
    o Design: List of saved drinks, each with options to reorder or remove.
    o User Flow: Users can quickly order saved items without re-browsing the menu.
13. Payments Screen
    o Purpose: Facilitates the checkout process.
    o Design: Offers various payment options (card, mobile wallet, or cash), with secure form fields for each method.
    o User Flow: Users select their preferred payment method and confirm the order.
14. Success Notification Screen
    o Purpose: Confirms successful actions (e.g., order placement, account creation).
    o Design: Simple message with action details, such as "Order Placed Successfully!" or "Account Created!", and a button to return to the Home Screen.
    o User Flow: Provides clear feedback and confidence in completed actions.
    Each of these screens supports a seamless user journey, from browsing to ordering, ensuring a positive customer experience.
    User Flow and Interactivity
    The hi-fi prototype also included interactivity to simulate user flow through sample purchase processes. Navigation elements and buttons were made clickable, enabling users to experience the app’s primary functions, including browsing, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
    Tools Used
    • Figma: Used for both lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, Figma provided an intuitive workspace to design screens, add interactivity, and easily switch between design and prototyping modes.
    • Plugins: Figma plugins were used to enhance the visual presentation, allowing for easy access to icons, placeholders, and other design elements.
    Challenges
    One challenge was balancing simplicity with feature richness, aiming for a minimal interface without sacrificing functionality. Additionally, creating an inviting visual theme without overwhelming the user required careful choice of color, imagery, and element placement.
    Outcome and Learnings
    The final hi-fi prototype is a functional, visually cohesive mockup that aligns with project goals. This assignment offered practical experience in user-centered design, from wireframing to creating a realistic prototype. Working in Figma strengthened my skills in layout design, interaction creation, and design workflow management.
    Conclusion
    This project provided valuable insights into the design process, from initial sketches to a polished hi-fi prototype. The ChocoSip prototypes demonstrate how a well-designed app can enhance the customer experience, providing an enjoyable, intuitive way to explore and order products. Future iterations could benefit from user testing and feedback to further refine and perfect the experience.
